 * @class Widget
 * @brief Base class for UI widgets that can be rendered and interact with user input
 * @details This abstract base class provides a common interface for all widgets in the system.
 *          It manages the u8g2 display context and defines the core methods that all widgets
 *          must implement or can override. The class follows the template method pattern,
 *          allowing derived classes to customize behavior while maintaining a consistent
 *          interface for the UI system.
 *
 * @note All widgets should inherit from this class to ensure compatibility with
